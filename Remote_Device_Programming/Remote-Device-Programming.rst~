ROCnRDMA
=========
ROCmRDMA is the solution designed to allow third-party kernel drivers to utilize DMA access to the GPU  memory. It allows direct path for data exchange (peer-to-peer) using the standard features of PCI Express. 

Currently ROCmRDMA provides the following benefits:

 * Direct access to ROCm memory for 3rd party PCIe devices
 * Support for PeerDirect(c) interface to offloads the CPU when dealing 
   with ROCm memory for RDMA network stacks;

Restrictions and limitations
*****************************
To fully utilize ROCmRDMA  the number of limitation could apply impacting either performance or functionality in the whole:

 * It is recommended that devices utilizing ROCmRDMA share the same upstream PCI Express root complex. Such limitation depends on    	PCIe chipset manufacturses and outside of GPU controls;
 * To provide peer-to-peer DMA access all GPU local memory must be exposed via PCI memory BARs (so called large-BAR configuration);
 * It is recommended to have IOMMU support disabled or configured in pass-through mode due to limitation in Linux kernel to support  	local PCIe device memory for any form transition others then 1:1 mapping.

ROCmRDMA interface specification
*********************************
The implementation of ROCmRDMA interface could be found in `[amd_rdma.h] <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCK-Kernel-Driver/blob/roc-1.4.0/include/drm/amd_rdma.h>`_ file.
